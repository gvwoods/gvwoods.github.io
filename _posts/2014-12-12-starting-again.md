I was recently talking with a co-worker and he was talking about creating a blog, and I had mentioned that I have had a blog since 2007. Which got me thinking that I have not done a blog post in at least a year. So, I decided to try and start the blog back up. Unfortunately, it looks like all of my old posts are gone.

Most of the content of this blog will be about Microsoft Business Intelligence tools, SQL Server and a few other technology items.

Let&#8217;s hope I can keep this blog updated.
