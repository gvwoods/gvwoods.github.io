Plain and simple, DO NOT distort the truth just to make your comments seem more important.  
A little background. I was watching a tv show the other night and they put these to charts side by side. They were emphasizing how the curve of the new cases in NYC was matching the curve of the new cases in Italy and how the US was heading for trouble. If you look closely, you will see the Y and X axis for each of the charts do not match. If the NYC charts axis matched the other chart, you would see a flatter line that would look more like the Spain line.
