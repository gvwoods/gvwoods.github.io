I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to travel many places this past year and even a few places more than once. Actually, I was in NYC twice within a 3 week span. The first time I was more in the heart of Times Square, so I wandered around and did all of the touristy things in that area. I even tried to go to Rockefeller Center to see the tree lighting, but after working my way through the crowds and the police checkpoint, I only made it to where I could hear the activities, but the corner of a building blocked my view. I tried a different street and was able to see the big screen, but decided to venture back to the hotel and watch it on tv. I knew I would be back in NYC in a little over a week and I would then have the chance to see the tree lit up.

So when I returned to NYC, I did go see the tree all lit up, once in the daylight and once at night. The nice thing about this trip was that I actually arrived a day early, so I had plenty of time to see things I haven&#8217;t previously seen. I was much closer to Central Park, away from most of the tourists, but on Sunday, I had a list of items that I wanted to make sure I saw. Below is the &#8220;loop&#8221; that I created. It was roughly 13 miles and about 5 1/2 hours, but it was so worth it.  
  


I started by going past Trump International Tower  
15 Central Park West  
Walk up to John Lennon&#8217;s house &#8211; Dakota Apartments  
Entered Central Park at Strawberry Fields  
Spent sometime at the Imagine&nbsp;memorial  
Headed to the pond and Central Park Bridge  
Loeb Boathouse  
NY MET museum &#8211;&nbsp;only walked past  
Walked Park Ave  
Wandered around Bloomingdales, and was quite surprised by some of the prices.  
Stopped at a local Pizza shop  
Continued down to United Nations  
on to Grand Central Station  
Bryant Park &#8211; Holiday Shops and Ice Rink  
Rockefeller Center  
back up 5th Ave  
Nike Innovation Store  
Trump Tower  
back to Central Park entrance  
Columbus Circle
