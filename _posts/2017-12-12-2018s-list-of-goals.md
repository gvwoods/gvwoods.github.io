Many items peak my interest and that can sometimes make it difficult to choose a few that I would like to gain a deeper learning of, but I think my current role will guide me in 2018.

In no particular order:

<u><b>SQL Server on Linux:</b></u> This is a no brainer. As long as I can remember, I have preferred to work with command line over gui based tools. I&#8217;ve always felt like I have more control over what I am doing. And now that SQL Server is on Linux, I want to dig in and learn whatever I can. I think I also like the idea, that there aren&#8217;t a lot of SQL Server DBA&#8217;s that are familiar with Linux.

**<u>Cloud:</u>** I&#8217;ve played around in the cloud for years, but with little reason. Between Azure options and the Oracle Cloud, it&#8217;s time to start looking at the differences and see where each can help me.

**<u>Power BI:</u>** With Power BI Premium, I think this is a game changer for Corporate adoption.

**<u>Make it to PASS Summit:</u>** I&#8217;ve been to Oracle Open World 3 times, but do to job responsibilities or other co-workers training needs, I have unfortunately never made it to PASS. I don&#8217;t mind Open World, but more and more I can see PASS being more beneficial.
