I received an email today from FindTime Notifications. If you haven&#8217;t heard of this Outlook add-in, it&#8217;s a pretty cool addition from Microsoft, that allows you to ask people outside of your company to vote on times that they would be available to meet. You can mark a time slot as preferred, yes, or no. You can also suggest other time slots. Next time you need to schedule a meeting, take a look at <https://findtime.microsoft.com/>
