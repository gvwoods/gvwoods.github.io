I just recently came back to my blog and noticed that my last post stated that I was going back to Oracle. I did, but the fit with that employer was not the best and I moved on to another company at the beginning of 2016. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with that move in 2016. I get to work with SQL Server and Oracle along with other software packages. Some items that I am working on or researching and would like to blog about in the future, Automic Scheduling software, SQL Server on Linux, Azure, Azure Analysis Services, Business Intelligence, Power BI, Oracle Data Guard, Oracle Cloud and other various items.
