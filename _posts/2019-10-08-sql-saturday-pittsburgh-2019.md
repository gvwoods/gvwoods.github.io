This past Saturday, October 5, 2019, I spoke at my very first SQL Saturday. The experience was amazing and getting to meet many of the people that I had previously only talk to through twitter, was a huge bonus. I can see why a lot of the same people present all over the country, it&#8217;s exhilarating. I do think it&#8217;s hilarious that the most difficult part of this for me, was to ONLY speak for an hour. With my job at Microsoft, I am constantly doing 3 day or longer workshops, so to talk for an hour felt like I was just getting started. I can remember back in High School, I was terrified to speak in front of the class, now, I love to do presentations. Anyways, if you are thinking about adding the Presenter title to your resume, jump right in and submit an abstract for a SQL Saturday. Everyone is very welcoming. 

If you are looking for a presenter, let&#8217;s talk and see if we can work something out.
