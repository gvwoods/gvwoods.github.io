On New Year&#8217;s Eve 2017, I blogged about wanting to read more and I put out a list of books that I was hoping to read. I technically only read one book, _Hit Refresh_, Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, but that&#8217;s because I decided to download audio books from my library and listen to them in the car. I have a 30-40 minute commute each way for work. Below is the list of books I completed. I really enjoyed and would recommend each of these. I actually didn&#8217;t realize until putting this list together, that I went through so many books. There were some other books that I started and stopped because they didn&#8217;t interest me, but I didn&#8217;t list them.
