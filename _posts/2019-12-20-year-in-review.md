Wow, what a year it has been for my career. I fulfilled a life long dream and joined Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer, I have traveled all over North America helping people begin or enhance their Data initiatives, I spoke at my first SQLSaturday and I gained two certifications: Azure Administrator and Azure Fundamentals. I know this is just the beginning of an exciting journey, but I can&#8217;t wait to see what&#8217;s next.
