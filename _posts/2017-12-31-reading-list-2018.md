I don&#8217;t normally do New Year Resolutions, but during the Christmas break I was reading numerous articles on LinkedIn, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed Linkedin, with it&#8217;s career connections and articles. However, I also realized how much wasted time I spent on Facebook and Twitter, so because it&#8217;s that time of year, I am calling this my &#8220;New Year&#8217;s Resolution&#8221;: **Spend more time bettering myself and my career** 

First up, purchase a kindle and I got a great deal. I wasn&#8217;t looking for two kindles, but when I saw Amazon had a special deal, buy two kindles get $60 off, I couldn&#8217;t pass the opportunity to gain some bonus points with my wife. Her kindle is a few years old and only 6gb, so I was able to get two Kindle Fire HD 8&#8217;s for $99.

Create a list of books to read and afterwards write a review. I am sure this list will continue to grow, but for starters and in no particular order:
