A little less than a month ago I attended Oracle Open World in San Francisco. It&#8217;s been a few years since I last attended the conference. Although San Francisco seems to have changed the conference has stayed the same. Numerous days of sessions that are very informative. As I felt the last time I attended, many of the sessions seem like marketing sessions, this isn&#8217;t a bad thing, just different. I did really enjoy some sessions dealing with Oracle EBS, Oracle Cloud and DBA topics. One session &#8220;Navigating your DBA Career in the Oracle Cloud&#8221; by Craig Shallahamer from orapub.com was very eye opening. Enough so, that I have started to look more closely at my future.

PASS Summit is going on right now and unfortunately, I am not in attendance. However, thanks to PASSTV, I have been able to watch numerous days worth of keynotes and sessions. This is definitely a conference that I would like to attend in the future. I know a good amount of people that attend every year and love this conference.
